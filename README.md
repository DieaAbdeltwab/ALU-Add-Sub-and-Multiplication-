# ALU(Add , Sub and Multiplication)
## Logic Project
### Designing a ALU 64-bit
### Logisim simulator
### ALU Operations 
#### --> Addition, Subtraction & Multiplication 
#### At many times ,
#### there are problems(in logisim) because of complexness of the circuit (Final)  
#### So , I designed amore simple circuit by using 16 bit 
#### (full adder , subtractor and multiplier ) which are existed in logisim (Final lite)
