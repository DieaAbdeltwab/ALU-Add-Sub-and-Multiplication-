# ALU(Add , Sub and Multiplication)
## Logic Project (2020)
### Designing a ALU 64-bit
### Logisim simulator
### ALU Operations 
#### --> Addition, Subtraction & Multiplication 
#### At many times ,
#### there are problems(in logisim) because of complexness of the circuit (ALU (Add , Sub and Multiplication))  
#### So , I designed amore simple circuit by using 16 bit 
#### (full adder , subtractor and multiplier ) which are existed in logisim (ALU (Add , Sub and Multiplication) lite)
